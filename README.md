# BlockTimings
Benchmark utility for Qortal block timings

This is a utility based on CalDescents bash script 'https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/blob/master/tools/block-timings.sh' ported to Java and added UI with the possibility to setup multiple iterations with automatically increasing variables. 

The results are stored in the 'databases' folder. Databases can be deleted from there if needed.

For every iteration 3 tables will be created.

1. A table with all the blocks and their results.
2. A summary for this iteration.
3. A blocktime estimation for each level.

Enjoy!
